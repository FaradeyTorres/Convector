# Convector
Universal Converter is a powerful conversion tool

It is a universal desktop application created in Python using the Tkinter library for the graphical interface. It is designed for fast and accurate conversion of a wide variety of measurement units and currencies.

Functional features

The application offers two main modes of operation: a regular converter and a currency converter, each of which has its own unique capabilities.

The usual converter

This mode works with a wide range of physical quantities and contains 16 different categories. You can convert values such as:

* Weight: kilograms, grams, tons, pounds, and others.

* Length: meters, kilometers, inches, feet, miles.

* Volume: liters, gallons, pints, cubic meters, teaspoons and others.

* Temperature: Celsius, Fahrenheit, Kelvin.

* Area: square meters, hectares, acres, etc.

* Speed: m/s, km/h, mph, knots, Mach.

* Data: bits, bytes, kilobytes, megabytes, gigabytes, terabytes.

* Energy: joules, calories, kilowatt-hours, electron volts.

* Pressure: pascals, bars, atmospheres, PSI.

* Time: seconds, minutes, hours, days, weeks, years.

* Radiation: sievers, behrs, grays, X-rays, rads.

* Astronomy: light years, astronomical units, parsecs, lunar distance. (Note! Astronomical measurements are in beta testing and may be inaccurate.)

* Cuisine: grams, kilograms, ounces, pounds, teaspoons, glasses, liters.

* Angles: degrees, radians, degrees, revolutions.

Currency Converter

This mode allows you to convert currencies based on current exchange rates. The free Exchange API service is used for this purpose. The app can:

* Automatically update courses: It will download new exchange rates from the Internet.

* Cache data: If you have already updated the courses, the app will save them to a file and use this data to avoid making unnecessary requests.

To use this feature, you need to get a free API key and enter it in the app. (https://www.exchangerate-api.com/)

Additional features

* Conversion history: The application saves up to 20 recent conversions. You can clear the history or save it to a text file.

* User-friendly interface: Intuitive design allows you to quickly switch between modes, select units of measurement and enter values.

The program is available in English, Russian, Spanish, German and Chinese.
